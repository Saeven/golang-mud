# Multi-User Dimension (MUD), Programmed in Go

Just tinkering with Go, using a MUD as an exercise to learn the language. If you are a Go-pro and see something I can
improve, please let me know!

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/Saeven/golang-mud
```

## Usage

```sh
golang-mud run
```

### Commands

Commands are listed in the `commandList` map found in commands.go.  Adding a command is very simple, simply extend the map with your
command and its executable closure!


### Rooms

Rooms are currently only implemented as basic structs. A web-based SPA room editor sure would be cool.
